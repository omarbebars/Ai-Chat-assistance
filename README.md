# ðŸ¤– Chatty â€“ A Simple NLP Chatbot with GUI

Chatty is a basic chatbot that can understand what you say and respond in a meaningful way. It uses advanced language processing techniques to recognize what you want and give appropriate answers.

## What Chatty Can Do

- Understands your questions or commands by identifying your intent (what you want to know or do)
- Breaks down your sentences into simple parts to better understand your meaning
- Uses a trained AI model to decide how to respond based on what you say
- Has an easy-to-use graphical interface (GUI) that lets you chat with it like a normal conversation
- Comes with predefined topics and responses, but can be customized to cover more

## Special Features: Real-Time Weather and News

Chatty is not just a static program; it connects to the internet to provide up-to-date information:

- **Weather Information:** Chatty can tell you the current temperature and weather conditions in any city you ask about. It does this by connecting to a trusted weather service online.
  
- **Latest News:** Chatty can fetch the top headlines from reliable news sources, giving you a quick summary of whatâ€™s happening around the world right now.

## How It Works Behind the Scenes

The chatbot uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand your input. It breaks your sentences into tokens (small pieces), simplifies words to their base forms, and then matches your words against a list of known keywords.

Based on this understanding, Chatty predicts what you want (your intent) using a machine learning model trained on many example sentences.

The graphical user interface lets you type messages and see replies in a chat window, making the experience feel natural.

## Whatâ€™s Included in the Project

- The main chatbot program with the user interface
- A file defining different intents and the chatbotâ€™s possible responses
- The trained AI model that understands language
- Files that store the chatbotâ€™s vocabulary and intent categories

Chatty is designed to demonstrate how AI and natural language processing can create interactive, helpful assistants that understand and respond to human language.
